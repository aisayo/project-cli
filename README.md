# Project::Cli
# Here we go!
Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/project/cli`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

Project_cli will help you find the perfect recipe for your occasion. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'project-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install project-cli

## Usage

So Gouda is designed to connect users to delicious dutch for purchase and help them become more informed on EU designations and cultural heritage.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
